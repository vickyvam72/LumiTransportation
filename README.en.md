## 🌟 Why Lumi Transportation?

> Enter an **origin** and a **destination**, and Lumi works out **every sensible public-transport combination** (bus, minibus, train, even ride-hailing) with **travel time, fare, and where to get off**. Once you're on your way, Lumi **guides you with GPS** and tells you when to get off.

| | |
|---|---|
| 🗺️ **Every route combination** | Routes 9 and 9A appear as separate options, and so do JAK36 → LRT, 9C → Makasar → JAK108 and more. Not just one answer. |
| 🎯 **Filters you control** | Sort by Fastest, Cheapest or Fewest transfers, then pick modes: only trips that **include TJ**, or TJ + LRT, and so on. |
| 🚌 **Bus positions in the TJ app** | Every Transjakarta, Mikrotrans and Royaltrans leg has a **See bus position in the TJ app** button that opens the official TJ app, or the Play Store if it isn't installed. |
| 🧭 **GPS guidance** | See where you are, **how many stops are left**, and feel a vibration for **"Get ready"** and **"Get off now"**, even with the screen off. |
| 🔔 **Know when routes change** | Official Transjakarta data is **checked every hour**. New routes, removed routes or changed stops trigger a **notification**. |
| 🖼️ **Share as an image** | Every route can be shared as a **clean image** to WhatsApp, Instagram or anywhere. |
| 💸 **Correct fares** | Transferring inside a station is free; leaving the station means tapping in again. Covers SH2, Hub Connector, MRT per-station fares and Airport Rail. |
| 🌙 **Knows opening hours** | At midnight Lumi only uses 24-hour services (AMARI corridors 1–14, JAK36/47/52/75) and ride-hailing. |
| 📍 **Addresses from Google Maps** | Find a place in Google Maps, tap **Share → Lumi**. The place's coordinates are read automatically. |
| 🪶 **Tiny and offline** | About **350 KB**. Route planning runs **on your phone**, with no server. |

## ✨ Features

**🗺️ Journey planner**
- **Offline** routing engine (graph + Dijkstra) plus a systematic search of **every direct route and every two-route combination**, so options like 9/9C → Makasar → JAK36/JAK108 and LRT → TMII → JAK36 show up
- **Same-code variants** kept apart, e.g. corridor 9 towards Pluit **via the toll road**, skipping Kemanggisan to Jembatan Dua
- Loop routes (e.g. JAK36 Cilangkap → Cililitan → Cilangkap) handled correctly: board and alight on the right side of the road, and **don't ride the loop** just to walk a bit less
- Duplicate options and pointless "ride one stop, then walk" options are removed
- **Depart at / arrive by**, using each mode's operating hours
- **Ride-hailing + train** combinations and direct motorbike/car ride-hailing, with road distance from OSRM

**🚌 Bus positions**
- Transjakarta's fleet server only serves its official app, so Lumi doesn't show bus positions itself. Each bus leg has a **See bus position in the TJ app** button that opens the TJ app, or the Play Store if it isn't installed

**🧭 GPS guidance**
- The map shows only what's left of the trip: passed lines and stops disappear; the first walk starts from where you are now
- Walking is shown as blue dots along real streets (foot routing from [routing.openstreetmap.de](https://routing.openstreetmap.de) and road routing from [OSRM](https://project-osrm.org), whichever fits best)
- **Picture-in-picture**: a small live map plus instructions stay visible while you use other apps; closing the window closes the app
- **Compass beam**: your location dot shows which way your phone is facing
- A prompt to turn on GPS when phone location is off

**🎯 Result filters**
- Sort: **Recommended · Fastest · Cheapest · Fewest transfers**
- Modes: **Transjakarta · Mikrotrans · LRT · MRT · KRL · Royaltrans · Airport Rail · Whoosh · Ride-hailing**. Shown trips **include every selected mode** and may combine others

**🧭 Guidance mode**
- Tap **Start guidance** on a trip
- GPS runs in a **foreground service**, so it keeps working with the screen off or the app in the background
- Live notification: *"JAK36 · 2 stops left · get off at UP Angkutan Sekolah"*
- Vibrating alerts: **Get ready** (one stop left) and **Get off now** (with the next connection)
- Your position on the trip map, and the current step marked **"You are here"**

**🔔 Always-current routes**
- On first launch Lumi downloads the **official Transjakarta GTFS** and processes it on the phone
- **Every hour** (in the background, very little data) Lumi checks:
  1. the route-change feed in this repo (`data/route_changes.json`), updated hourly by GitHub Actions, and
  2. the version signature of the official GTFS file (ETag / Last-Modified / size)
- When something changes, route data is re-downloaded, differences are computed (new or removed routes, stops added/removed, variant patterns changed) and a **notification** appears
- History is shown on Home and in **Settings → Route changes**

**🖼️ Share routes as images**
- **Share route** button on every result card and on the trip screen
- PNG with origin → destination, total time and fare, a mode strip, and step-by-step boarding times, directions, stops and fares

**📍 Addresses via Google Maps**
- Tap From/To → **Search in Google Maps** → pick the place → **Share → Lumi Transportation**
- The **place** coordinates are read from the link (not the map view), using three methods in parallel, and cached for instant reuse
- **Saved places**, **My location**, and pick-on-map

**🎨 Look & feel**
- **Light-blue** theme with a blue-gradient logo; welcome and permission screens that **fit on one screen**
- Full route info: search routes (`9`, `13C`, `JAK.10`, `Bogor`, `MRT`), stop order, directions, variants, operating hours, and connections at each stop
- **OpenFreeMap** vector maps (MapLibre GL) — free, no API key; Liberty, Bright, Positron or standard OpenStreetMap styles

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Guidance or route-change notifications don't appear</b></summary>

Make sure notifications are allowed and **background running** is enabled (phone Settings → Apps → Lumi Transportation → Battery → Unrestricted). On Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Realme and Infinix also enable **Auto-start**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How quickly does Lumi learn about route changes?</b></summary>

Within about **1 hour** of Transjakarta updating its official GTFS. GitHub Actions in this repo checks the GTFS every hour, and the app checks the GTFS file's version signature every hour too. Changes announced only on social media (e.g. temporary diversions) are picked up once they reach the official data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The location from Google Maps is off</b></summary>

Share the **place** (tap the place name → Share), not the map view. If coordinates still can't be read, Lumi opens a map so you can drag the pin.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The fare in Lumi differs from what I paid</b></summary>

Fares are estimates based on published rules (see [Fares used](#-fares-used)). Promotions, holiday fares and ride-hailing surge pricing can differ.
</details>

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Part | Technology |
|---|---|
| App | **Java** (plain Android SDK, no extra libraries) + **WebView** |
| UI | Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Plus Jakarta Sans font |
| Maps | **Leaflet** + **MapLibre GL** (maplibre-gl-leaflet) with **OpenFreeMap** vector tiles (OpenStreetMap); standard OSM tiles as fallback |
| Routing | Multimodal graph + Dijkstra + combination search (`engine.js`), offline |
| Route data | Official Transjakarta GTFS (processed on the phone by `GtfsImporter.java`) |
| Background | Foreground service (GPS guidance), JobScheduler (hourly and daily route checks) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions: build the APK on every push and watch for route changes every hour |

### 🏗️ Build from source
Lumi builds **without Gradle**, using `aapt2`, `ecj`, `d8` and `apksigner`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vickyvam72/LumiTransportation.git
cd LumiTransportation
export ANDROID_JAR=$ANDROID_HOME/platforms/android-34/android.jar
export AAPT2=$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/34.0.0/aapt2
export D8_JAR=$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/34.0.0/lib/d8.jar
export APKSIGNER_JAR=$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/34.0.0/lib/apksigner.jar
export ECJ_JAR=/path/to/ecj.jar          # org.eclipse.jdt:ecj
./build.sh                                # output: build/LumiTransportation.apk
node tools/test_engine.js                 # routing engine tests
```

> 🔐 Release builds are signed with a key stored in **GitHub Actions Secrets** (`LUMI_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `LUMI_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, optional `LUMI_KEY_ALIAS`). The key is never stored in the repo. Without secrets, the workflow still builds the APK as an artifact but doesn't publish a release.
